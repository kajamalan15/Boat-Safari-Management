# Boat-Safari-Management
As part of a group project at SLIIT, I contributed to the development of the "Blessed Blue Way" Boat Safari Management System, a web application designed to enhance customer engagement and streamline operations.Utilizing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, we created a platform for users to check packages, make reservations, and view galleries. My role focused on the Manager module, where I implemented CRUD operations to manage employee accounts, handle salary details, and facilitate sponsor communications. Additionally, I designed wireframes for the sponsor page, cost of production page, and manager portal. This system improved data security, consistency, and operational efficiency through robust database management and backup recoveryÂ features.
